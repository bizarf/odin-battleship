# The Odin Project - Project: Battleship

This is a project where I will be implementing the game "Battleship" in Javascript, and HTML. 

Note: Mobile support is not 100% as it doesn't support drag events, but the game can still be played by using the place pieces randomly button to place the player pieces.
